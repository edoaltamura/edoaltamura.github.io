### Hi there! üëã

I am a UK-based quantum research software engineer at the Hartree Centre, a national lab doing
research in AI and emerging technologies. Here, I run collaboration projects with IBM Quantum & IBM
Research, AstraZeneca, the University of Cambridge, and other research partners.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Manchester, [Jodrell Bank Centre
for Astrophysics](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/), doing research in galaxy cluster
astrophysics using numerical multi-physics simulations and high-performance computers.

I am a core developer of [Qiskit Machine Learning](https://github
.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning), a community product that can help you build and run
machine learning workloads on quantum computers seamlessly using Qiskit.

As an individual passionate about data science and visualization, I have helped organizations and
publishers elevate their projects by providing technical [services](./services/index.qmd). Find out
more about my portfolio and [contact me](mailto:edoardo.altamura@stfc.ac.uk) if you're interested in
collaborating on an interesting project.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="üìù Bio" icon="false"}
I was born in Macerata, a small town in central Italy, where I lived until high-school.

There, I was attending public stargazings, hosted at PF de Vico astronomical observatory, managed
 by the Crabnebula astronomy society. I can safely state that this is how all my interest in
 astronomy, physics and science in general begun. Soon after, I completed in the Italian
 Astronomy Olympiads (years 2011 - 2014) and the International Astronomy Olympiads (Almaty,
 Kazakhstan 2011 & Vilnius, Lithuania 2013).

Roughly simultaneously to the Astronomy Olympiads, I also developed a passion for the most
‚Äúhands-on‚Äù aspects of Astronomy and I decided to invest in a Celestron Starbright C9.25, SkyWatcher
NEQ6 and a Canon EOS 1100D - my first proper telescope and camera setups. Despite the gear not
being optimised for long exposures on very faint celestial objects, I managed to observe and capture
several nebulae and star clusters, with several exceptional views on the moon and planets during nights
with good seeing. On 6th June 2012 I finished building a mylar-based solar filter at the very last
minuted just in time for Venus‚Äôs transit in front of the Sun. Luckily, the sky was partially clear
towards the East, and together with the Crabnebula Astronomy society members we watched the sunrise
when Venus was just about to cross the Sun's disk.

Several more special events brightened up my experience with many new incredible friends, fellow
astronomy enthusiasts and even professionals, encouraging me to start a Masters and Ph.D. degrees in
Astrophysics and Cosmology at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester.
