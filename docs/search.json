    "text": "Hi there! 👋\nI am a UK-based quantum research software engineer at the Hartree Centre, a national lab doing research in AI and emerging technologies. Here, I run collaboration projects with IBM Quantum & IBM Research, AstraZeneca, the University of Cambridge, and other research partners.\nPreviously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Manchester, Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, doing research in galaxy cluster astrophysics using numerical multi-physics simulations and high-performance computers.\nI am a core developer of Qiskit Machine Learning, a community product that can help you build and run machine learning workloads on quantum computers seamlessly using Qiskit.\nAs an individual passionate about data science and visualization, I have helped organizations and publishers elevate their projects by providing technical services. Find out more about my portfolio and contact me if you’re interested in collaborating on an interesting project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💼 Institutional positions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent roles\nQuantum Research Software Engineer - Hartree Centre, STFC\n\nPI of the STFC project account with the University of Cambridge, and\nthe IBM high-energy physics working group\nCo-PI of the STFC partnership with AstraZeneca on post-BO chemical dynamics\n\nVisiting Research Fellow - University of Cambridge\n\nWorking directly with Prof. David Wales’ group and collaborating with the theoretical chemistry group.\n\nVisiting Research Fellow - University of Manchester\n\nVirgo Consortium for Computational Cosmology Research\nEuclid space mission Consortium (Science Working Group, Cosmology Theory)\nCMB Stage-4 experiments Collaboration\n\n\n\nPrevious roles\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow - University of Manchester\n\nParticles At heXascale (PAX) program within ExCALIBUR\nVirgo Consortium for Computational Cosmology Research\nEAGLE-XL Collaboration in the Virgo Consortium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📝 Bio\n\n\n\n\n\nI was born in Macerata, a small town in central Italy, where I lived until high-school.\nThere, I was attending public stargazings, hosted at PF de Vico astronomical observatory, managed by the Crabnebula astronomy society. I can safely state that this is how all my interest in astronomy, physics and science in general begun. Soon after, I completed in the Italian Astronomy Olympiads (years 2011 - 2014) and the International Astronomy Olympiads (Almaty, Kazakhstan 2011 & Vilnius, Lithuania 2013).\nRoughly simultaneously to the Astronomy Olympiads, I also developed a passion for the most “hands-on” aspects of Astronomy and I decided to invest in a Celestron Starbright C9.25, SkyWatcher NEQ6 and a Canon EOS 1100D - my first proper telescope and camera setups. Despite the gear not being optimised for long exposures on very faint celestial objects, I managed to observe and capture several nebulae and star clusters, with several exceptional views on the moon and planets during nights with good seeing. On 6th June 2012 I finished building a mylar-based solar filter at the very last minuted just in time for Venus’s transit in front of the Sun. Luckily, the sky was partially clear towards the East, and together with the Crabnebula Astronomy society members we watched the sunrise when Venus was just about to cross the Sun’s disk.\nSeveral more special events brightened up my experience with many new incredible friends, fellow astronomy enthusiasts and even professionals, encouraging me to start a Masters and Ph.D. degrees in Astrophysics and Cosmology at Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester."
